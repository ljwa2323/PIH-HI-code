# PIH-HI-code

Welcome to PIH-HI Classification - A Trajectory Classification System for Post-induction Hypotension!

This system is a machine learning-based prediction tool designed to help clinicians classify and predict blood pressure trajectories after anesthesia induction. By inputting patient data including basic information, surgery-related information, medication usage, and comorbidities, the system can predict the pattern of blood pressure changes following anesthesia induction.

Through the navigation bar, you can easily switch between different functional pages. To promote transparency and facilitate local adaptation, all source code for this system is publicly available at https://github.com/ljwa2323/PIH-HI-code . We hope this tool will provide valuable reference for your clinical decision-making.

You can utilize this system through the following modules:
- Prediction: Input detailed patient information on this page, including basic information (age, gender, etc.), surgical information, use of vasoactive drugs, anesthetic induction medications, hypertension control status, and preoperative comorbidities.
- Classification: View blood pressure trajectory classification results, including trajectory plots, event odds ratios, and feature importance analysis.
- Trajectory References: Access reference information about blood pressure trajectory classification.
